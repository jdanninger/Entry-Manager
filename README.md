## Description 
This is a simple piece of software created in order to help me comply with my high school's COVID-19 restrictions.  Entry Manager helps me track of who attended my school's MUN meeting, for how long, and how to contact them if they were exposed to the coronavirus. 

## Development Story
This was the solution I created for my first hackathon, which I did solo. The event was six hours long. I only had basic understanding of Python, therefore I spent a majority of the time teaching myself how to use **pandas** to export data to a spreadsheet, and **IPython** to create an easy to use interface. 

The little time I had left I rushed to create a working final product that would be presentable. The lack of time led to the project being very simplistic, however I am very proud that I managed to learn and implement so many new skills in such a short timeframe.

## Setup
In order to run entry manager the following is required
 - Python
 - Pip (needed to install libraries and comes with recent versions of  Python)
 - tkinter
	 - `pip install tk`
 - pandas
	 - `pip install pandas`
 - Ipython
	 - `pip install ipython`

**Alternatively there is an executable avaiable**
 - Can be found in the Executable Version folder
 - Inside the folder there are 2 easy to use shortcuts, one runs Entry Manager and the other is the spreadsheet where Entry Manager stores data

## How to use
Entry Manager is remarkably simple, just fill out the boxes then press submit. Afterwards the answers are recorded in a separate spreadsheet. The interface can be seen below

The csv spreadsheet can be opened with most spreadsheet software, most notably Microsoft excel.
